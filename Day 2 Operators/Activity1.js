// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operators

// Task 1: Write a program that add two numbers and log the result to the console.

let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 30;

// Task 2: Write a program that subtracts two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(`Subtraction of ${num1} and ${num2} `,num2 - num1);

// Task 3: Write a program that multiplies two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(`Multiplication of ${num1} and ${num2} `, num1*num2 )

// Task 4: Write a program that divides two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(`Divsion of ${num2} by ${num1} `, num2/num1 )

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
console.log(`Remiander of ${num2} divided by (${num1} - 2)`, num2 % (num1 - 2))
